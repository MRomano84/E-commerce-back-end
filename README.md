## Description
This is a backend application that allows an E-commerce company can use `Express.js` to manage their inventory in a database. A user can create, update, delete and see everything in the database using `sequelize` and `mysql2`. All sensitive information is stored in a `.env` file and this application uses the `dotenv` package to hide the information.

## Technologies Used
Express.js, Sequelize, Node.js, JavaScript, MySQL2, SQL, dotenv, nodemon

## Installation
Clone the application. In the root folder, create a .env file and store your own login information to the database in key:value pairs. In your database client create a database. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies. Run `npm run seed` to seed the database. Run `npm start` to start the server(notice the console log will show the port the server is listening on). I recommend using Postman to interact with the API.
